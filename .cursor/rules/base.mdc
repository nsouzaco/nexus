# Adapt Clone Project Rules

## Project Overview
AI-powered business intelligence tool connecting to Notion, Google Drive, Airtable, and GitHub.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
- OpenAI GPT-4o
- Vercel (deployment)

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript with proper type annotations
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if truly dynamic

### React/Next.js
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- Use `"use client"` directive explicitly when required
- Prefer server actions for form submissions
- Use Next.js Image component for images

### Supabase
- Use `createServerClient` for server-side operations
- Use `createBrowserClient` for client-side operations
- Always check for user session before database operations
- Use RLS policies for security (never bypass with service role in client code)

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Use shadcn/ui components as the base
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS variables for theming

### API Routes
- Validate all inputs
- Return consistent error responses
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error handling

### Security
- Never log sensitive data (tokens, passwords)
- Always encrypt tokens at rest
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Validate user sessions on protected routes
- RLS policies on all database tables
